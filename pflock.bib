However, less attention has been paid to the analysis of urban structure (especially commuting pattern) using smart card data (SCD), which are widely available in most large cities in China, and even in the world. This paper combines bus SCD for a one-week period with a oneday household travel survey, as well as a parcel-level land use map to identify job–housing locations and commuting trip routes in Beijing. Two data forms are proposed, one for jobs–housing identification and the other for commuting trip route identification. The results of the identification are aggregated in the bus stop and traffic analysis zone (TAZ) scales, respectively. Particularly, commuting trips from three typical residential communities to six main business zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting patterns in Beijing. The identified commuting trips are validated by comparison with those from the survey in terms of commuting time and distance, and the positive validation results prove the applicability of our approach. Our experiment, as a first step toward enriching LBS data using conventional survey and urban GIS data, can obtain solid identification results based on rules extracted from existing surveys or censuses.},

In addition, the model can be used to compute a probabilistic prediction of the pedestrian's location many time steps ahead, and to aid the recognition of unusual behaviour identified as atypical object motion.},

One of the main hurdles they have to overcome is the study of groups of people classified by their socio-economic status (one of the main means for governments, companies and research organisations to group together segments of the population).The amount of data collected by governments, business and research organisations has increased markedly in recent years. Geographic Information Systems have been more widely used than ever before for the storage and analysis of this information. Most GIS can handle this information spatially rather than temporally, and have difficulty with the management of socio-economic time series, which relate to spatial units. Accordingly, this book covers the issues ranging from the formal model to differentiate aspects of spatio-temporal data, through philosophical and fundamental reconsideration of time and space to the development of practical solutions to the problem. This book draws together an interdisciplinary group of scientists in the field of geography, computing, surveying and philosophy. It presents the definitive sourcebook on temporal GIS as applied to socio-economic units.},

We assume that the user movement data are collected by logging location data emitted from mobile devices tracking users. We formally define group pattern as a group of users that are within a distance threshold from one another for at least a minimum duration. To mine group patterns, we first propose two algorithms, namely AGP and VG-growth. In our first set of experiments, it is shown when both the number of users and logging duration are large, AGP and VG-growth are inefficient for the mining group patterns of size two. We therefore propose a framework that summarizes user movement data before group pattern mining. In the second series of experiments, we show that the methods using location summarization reduce the mining overheads for group patterns of size two significantly. We conclude that the cuboid based summarization methods give better performance when the summarized database size is small compared to the original movement database. In addition, we also evaluate the impact of parameters on the mining overhead.},

Groups are defined as sets of MPOs that are directly or transitively related to each other via freely definable binary relations. Group candidates are identified within a snapshot view of the MPOs at discrete time instances. By backtracking over previous snapshots, stable group compositions over previous time instances are identified and reported. We give insight about the used data structures and algorithms for the group candidate calculation and backtracking steps and illustrate the approach's functionality with examples from a real data set.},

	abstract = {With the ubiquitous use of location enabled devices, pattern discovery in trajectories has been receiving increasing interest. Among such patterns, we have queries related to how groups of moving objects behave over time such as discovering flocks. A flock pattern is defined as a set of moving objects that move within a predefined distance to each other for a given continuous period of time. A typical application example is surveillance, where relies on discovering flocks on very large streaming spatiotemporal data efficiently. Previous work presented a polynomial solution to the problem of finding flocks with fixed time duration. And presented as well a set of algorithms based on this solution, which are the state-of-the-art algorithms regarding this problem. In this paper, we improve those algorithms by applying the plane sweeping technique in conjunction to an inverted index. The plane sweeping accelerates the detection of groups of objects that are candidates to be a flock in a time instant and the inverted index is used to compare candidate disks across time instants quickly. Using an assortment of real-world trajectory datasets, we show that our proposed methods are very efficient. When compared with the baseline flock algorithm, our proposed methods achieved up to 46x speedup reducing the elapsed time from thousands of seconds to milliseconds.},

The main goal in studying such patterns is to discover spatial relationships over time between moving objects. Recent articles have proposed a wide variety of such patterns, among them is the flock pattern. This pattern is defined as a set of moving objects with minimum size that stay together within a maximum distance for a continuous period of time. Typical application examples are monitoring and surveillance, which rely on efficiently identifying groups of suspicious people/vehicles in large spatiotemporal streaming data. Previous works proposed polynomial-time algorithms to the flock pattern problem with fixed time duration. In this article, we propose a new online method, called PSI, which is an improved base method to discover flock patterns that applies computational geometry techniques (e.g., plane sweeping) along with binary signatures and inverted indexes. In summary, plane sweeping speeds up the detection of candidate groups in a particular timestamp, binary signatures allow saving costly set intersection operations, and inverted indexes are employed to quickly compare candidate disks across timestamps. Using a variety of real-world datasets and a large synthetic one we show that our proposed methods are efficient compared to state-of-the-art solution. In our experimental evaluation our proposed method achieved up to 69 times speedup compared to the previous solution.},

With such data, important information can be retrieved, where co-movement patterns stand out in finding groups of moving objects moving together. However, such pattern mining algorithms are not simple and commonly require non-trivial fixed parameters as input, which are extremely dependent on the data domain and also impacted by many others context variables, being such challenging task also to domain specialists. One example of these patterns is the flock pattern that has as its most challenging parameter the distance threshold that is the size of the disks that involves the objects. Although other density-based approaches reduce the impact of the restrictions of the disk, all of them still require a distance parameter for the density connectedness. Addressing this problem, we introduce the concept of discovering of k-co-movement patterns, which is finding the top-k patterns, according to the desired raking criterion. Especially for the flock pattern, we also define a new flock pattern query and propose a top-down algorithm with free distance parameter for the aforementioned problem.},

A computationally simple-tracking method is proposed that works on single sensor data and combines multiple sensors so that large areas can be covered with a minimum number of sensors. Moreover, it can work with different sensor types and is robust to the imperfect sensor measurements; therefore, it is possible to combine currently available 3-D range sensor solutions to achieve tracking in wide public spaces. The method was implemented in a shopping center environment, and it was shown that good tracking performance can be achieved.},

These systems can be roughly categorized into Apache Hadoop-based and in-memory systems based on Apache Spark. The available features supported by these systems vary widely. However, there has not been any comprehensive evaluation study of these systems in terms of performance, scalability and functionality. To address this need, we propose a benchmark to evaluate Big Spatial Data systems. Although, Spark is a very popular framework, its performance is limited by the overhead associated with distributed resource management and coordination. The Big Spatial Data systems that are based on Spark, are also constrained by these. We introduce SpatialIgnite, a Big Spatial Data system that we have developed based on Apache Ignite. We investigate the present status of the Big Spatial Data systems by conducting a comprehensive feature analysis and performance evaluation of a few representative systems with our benchmark. Our study shows that SpatialIgnite performs better than Hadoop and Spark based systems that we have evaluated.},

We argue that for a solid establishment of the Integrated Science of Movement, a bottom-up approach is necessary, one based on existing literature which identifies similarities and differences across disciplines. We therefore review, compare, and contrast movement analysis methodologies from GIScience, movement ecology, geography, transportation, public health, computer science, and physics. We structure our review along the dichotomy of individual versus population-based movement or, using terminology from wildlife ecology, between the Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives. We further introduce a new unifying framework for movement research that is sufficiently general to cover any type of movement study in any discipline and that spans the Lagrangian/Eulerian divide, with the ambitious goal to bridge the gap between disciplines and lay a solid foundation for a new Integrated Science of Movement.},

While most previous work on trajectory-based queries has concentrated on traditional range, nearest-neighbor and similarity queries, there is an increasing interest in queries that capture the "aggregate" behavior of trajectories as groups. Consider, for example, finding groups of moving objects that move "together", i.e. within a predefined distance to each other, for a certain continuous period of time. Such queries typically arise in surveillance applications, e.g. identify groups of suspicious people, convoys of vehicles, flocks of animals, etc. In this paper we first show that the on-line flock discovery problem is polynomial and then propose a framework and several strategies to discover such patterns in streaming spatio-temporal data.

ROASC discovery can provide useful insights for studying unexpected spatial associations at regional scales. The main challenges are that the ROASCs are spatially arbitrary in geographic shape and the distributions of spatial features are unknown a priori. To avoid restrictive assumptions regarding the distribution of data, we propose a distribution-free method for discovering arbitrarily shaped ROASCs. First, we present a multidirectional optimization method to adaptively identify the candidate ROASCs, whose sizes and shapes are fully endogenized. Furthermore, the validity of the candidates is evaluated through significance tests under the null hypothesis that the expected spatial co-locations between two features occur consistently across space. To effectively model the null hypothesis, we develop a bivariate pattern reconstruction method by reconstructing the spatial auto- and cross-correlation structures observed in the data. Synthetic experiments and a case study conducted using Shanghai taxi datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method, in terms of effectiveness, over an available alternative method.},

	abstract = {Reporting the maximal cliques of a graph is a fundamental problem arising in many areas. This note bridges the gap between three papers addressing this problem: the original paper of Bron–Kerbosh [C. Bron, J. Kerbosch, Algorithm 457: Finding all cliques of an undirected graph, Communication of ACM 16 (9) (1973) 575–577], and two papers recently published in TCS, namely that of Tomita et al. [Tomita, A. Tanaka, H. Takahashi, The worst-case time complexity for generating all maximal cliques and computational experiments, Theoretical Computer Science 363 (1) (2006) 28–42], and that of Koch [I. Koch, Fundamental study: Enumerating all connected maximal common subgraphs in two graphs, Theoretical Computer Science 250 (1–2) (2001) 1–30]. In particular, we show that the strategy of Tomita et al. is a simple modification of the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm, based on an (un-exploited) observation raised in Koch’s paper.},

	abstract = {We investigate a number of recently reported exact algorithms for the maximum clique problem. The program code is presented and analyzed to show how small changes in implementation can have a drastic effect on performance. The computational study demonstrates how problem features and hardware platforms influence algorithm behaviour. The effect of vertex ordering is investigated. One of the algorithms (MCS) is broken into its constituent parts and we discover that one of these parts frequently degrades performance. It is shown that the standard procedure used for rescaling published results (i.e., adjusting run times based on the calibration of a standard program over a set of benchmarks) is unsafe and can lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn from empirical data.},

Our analysis shows that this algorithm is the first to offer a practical solution to listing all maximal cliques in large sparse graphs. All other theoretically-fast algorithms for sparse graphs have been shown to be significantly slower than the algorithm of Tomita et al. (Theoretical Computer Science, 2006) in practice. However, the algorithm of Tomita et al. uses an adjacency matrix, which requires too much space for large sparse graphs. Our new algorithm opens the door for fast analysis of large sparse graphs whose adjacency matrix will not fit into working memory.},

We show that there exists a nearly-optimal ﬁxed-parameter tractable algorithm for enumerating all maximal cliques, parametrized by degeneracy. To achieve this result, we modify the classic Bron–Kerbosch algorithm and show that it runs in time O(dn3d/3). We also provide matching upper and lower bounds showing that the largest possible number of maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph with degeneracy d (when d is a multiple of 3 and n ≥ d + 3) is (n − d)3d/3. Therefore, our algorithm matches the Θ (d(n − d)3d/3) worst-case output size of the problem whenever n − d = Ω (n).},

This is optimal as a function of n, since there exist up to 3n/3 maximal cliques in an n-vertex graph. The algorithm is also demonstrated to run very fast in practice by computational experiments.},
